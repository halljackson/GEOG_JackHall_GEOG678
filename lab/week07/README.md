## Lab 07
### Jack Hall

### The purpose of this lab was to get acquainted with ArcGIS Story Maps, and their potential for telling stories through a geographical lens. We created two separate story maps: one in 2D (using geolocated photos), and one in 3D, utilizing a 3D model of Texas A&M buildings to tell a story about the campus. <br>
